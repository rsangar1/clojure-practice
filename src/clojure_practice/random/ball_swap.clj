  " -=== Ball Swap ===-
  An illusionist is performing ball swaps.
  There are three cups on a table, at positions A, B, and C. At the start, there is a ball hidden under the cup at position B.
  Create a function that returns the letter position where the ball final position is once the swapping is finished.
  There will be several swaps perform, represented by two letters.
  For example, if I swap the cups at positions A and B, this can be represented as AB or BA.
  Examples
  swap-cups ([ AB CA ])  âžž C

  swap-cups ([AC CA CA AC]) => B

  swap-cups ([BA AC CA BC]) => A")
